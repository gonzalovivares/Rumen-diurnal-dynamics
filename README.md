# Rumen diurnal dynamics
This repository contains code that has been implemented to simulate diurnal dynamics of the mechanistic model of rumen function of Bannink et al. (2008). 

We included two example codes that calculate the diurnal patterns of dry matter intake and the updated calculation of rumen pH. Description of this model update is currently submitted for peer-review.
