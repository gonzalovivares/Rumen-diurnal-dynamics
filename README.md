# Rumen diurnal dynamics
This repository contains code that has been implemented to simulate diurnal dynamics of the mechanistic model of rumen function of Bannink et al. (2018) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2018.00066)

We included two example codes that calculate the diurnal patterns of dry matter intake and the updated calculation of rumen pH. Description of this model update is currently submitted for peer-review.
